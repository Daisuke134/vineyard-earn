place_order.py — EXECUTION: generalized V2 FAK order placement (#25 spec §2.2).

Copied from the real, currently-live anicca skill (`~/anicca/skills/earn/polymarket-trade/
place_order.py`, verified 2026-07-05) — NOT re-derived from `v2_full_flow.py` per this plan's
original D1 text: that file has since been DELETED upstream (anicca's own #25 adversary fix #2,
same day) and superseded by this already-parameterized, already-adversary-hardened script (SIWE mint
-> SecureClient bootstrap -> approve neg-risk spenders -> get_order_book -> create_market_order FAK
-> post_order), including the CLEAN-STDOUT GUARANTEE fix below (a real production bug: the SDK's own
stdout prints were merging onto the result line and breaking the caller's json.loads()). Reusing this
verified, already-fixed version rather than re-introducing that known bug is the "make sure it
actually works" call per HARD RULE 0.24/HONESTY RULES — see this repo's plan-deviation note in the
Task 9 commit message.

ONE deliberate edit vs the anicca original: the `PM_TRADE_AGENT_HOME`/`load_dotenv(...)` block that
loaded a hardcoded, anicca-specific `.env` path is removed — Vineyard's wrapper
(`engines/polymarket.mjs`) always injects `POLYGON_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`/`TOKEN_ID`/`SIDE`/`AMOUNT`/
`MAX_BET_SIZE` directly into this process's own env (per-instance, from `core/wallet.mjs`), so there is
no separate dotenv file to load — the same principle as D6(b)'s edit to `redeem.py`. Every other line
(SIWE mint, approvals, order-book read, FAK order placement, the stdout-redirect mechanism) is
byte-identical to the anicca original.

WHICH market/side/amount is entirely the caller's (Vineyard operator's / `vineyard trade`'s) decision —
this file only executes it and enforces the money-safety cap.

Inputs (env preferred, positional argv fallback):
  TOKEN_ID   CLOB token id to BUY                              (argv[1])
  SIDE       must be "BUY" — this flow only supports BUY;
             SELL needs shares already held, out of scope here (argv[2])
  AMOUNT     USD spend amount                                  (argv[3])
  POLYGON_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY  this instance's signer key (injected by
                              engines/polymarket.mjs from core/wallet.mjs)
  MAX_BET_SIZE (default 2)   hard cap on AMOUNT (money-safety, not judgment)

Output: exactly one line of JSON on the REAL stdout (guaranteed clean — see below):
  {"token_id","amount","order_id","post_result","ok"}
On any failure before an order can be attempted: {"ok": false, "error": "..."}
(exit code 1). Never places a fake/simulated order — no dry-run path exists.

CLEAN-STDOUT GUARANTEE (#25 adversary fix, accounting integrity, 2026-07-05):
a real Franklin fill ("Will Jesus Christ return before GTA VI?", NO, ~$1,
CONFIRMED filled on-chain) was mis-logged ok:false by run.sh because the
polymarket SDK (imported inside main(), during mint/credential-bootstrap)
printed to stdout and merged onto the SAME line as the result JSON, breaking
run.sh's json.loads(). Fix: `sys.stdout` at process start is captured as
`_REAL_STDOUT` before anything runs; ALL work (SDK import, SIWE mint,
approve, order book, order placement) runs under
`contextlib.redirect_stdout(sys.stderr)`, so any stray SDK/library print
lands on stderr. The ONLY thing ever written to `_REAL_STDOUT` is the single
final `_emit(...)` call — stdout is guaranteed to be exactly one clean JSON
line, so a real fill is never again mis-recorded as a parse failure.
