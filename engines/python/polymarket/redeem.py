redeem.py — collect (redeem) claude-p's RESOLVED, redeemable Polymarket positions,
turning open unrealized value into realized pUSD cash in the SAME deposit wallet.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Trading (v2_recipe.py / v2_full_flow.py) only OPENS positions. Nothing in this repo
ever collected a win — every position sat "redeemable=True" with real cash owed and
$0 actually realized. This is that missing last step: colony's first realized profit.

THE MECHANISM (verified against the installed SDK, not guessed)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The deposit wallet (`0x904B50d2…`, ERC-1167 proxy, POLY_1271 sig_type=3) is NOT an
EOA, so it can't sign its own transactions — every write goes through Polymarket's
gasless relayer, signed by the owner EOA (`0x810F6D61…`). This is the exact same
relayer path `v2_mint_deploy.py` already proved live for wallet deployment: SIWE
mint (no browser) -> RelayerApiKey -> `polymarket.clients.secure.SecureClient`.

That installed SDK (`polymarket-client` 0.1.0b13, in `.venv-pysdk`) ships a native
`SecureClient.redeem_positions(condition_id=...)` (secure.py:2188). It already knows
how to pick the right on-chain path per market:
  - regular CTF market  -> `ConditionalTokens.redeemPositions` via the collateral
    adapter (`normalize_market_position_context`, positions.py:66-95)
  - neg-risk market      -> the neg-risk collateral adapter instead
by reading the market's OWN `negRisk` flag (fetched via `list_markets`) — this is
mechanical dispatch on a fixed on-chain fact, not a strategy judgment, so it is
correctly deterministic code (R5), same as picking a URL scheme.

TWO REAL SDK GAPS FOUND (verified live, fixed here, not worked around blindly):
  1. `redeem_positions()`'s own market lookup omits `closed=True`, and Gamma's
     `/markets` endpoint silently excludes closed/resolved markets unless that
     flag is explicit (verified: `curl gamma-api/markets?slug=X` -> `[]`,
     `...&closed=true` -> the market). Since redeem() only ever targets RESOLVED
     (closed) markets, the wrapper always raised "No market found". Fixed by
     calling the same low-level primitives with `closed=True` in the lookup
     (`redeem_condition`, below).
  2. Before ANY redeem, the deposit wallet must grant the adapter contract
     ERC-1155 `setApprovalForAll` on the raw ConditionalTokens contract — verified
     by `eth_call` simulation: redeeming without it reverts
     `"ERC1155: need operator approval for 3rd party transfers"`; querying
     `CTF.isApprovedForAll(deposit_wallet, collateral_adapter)` on-chain returned
     `False`. This is the one-time step Polymarket's own web UI does silently
     before a user's first redeem; `ensure_ctf_operator_approval` does it here,
     idempotently (checks `isApprovedForAll` first, only sends a tx if needed).
     It authorizes redemption only — it cannot move pUSD/USDC and is fully
     revocable (`approved=False`).

Sources (quoted, no guessing):
  - installed `polymarket` package, `clients/secure.py::redeem_positions`,
    `::approve_erc1155_for_all`, and
    `_internal/actions/relayer/positions.py::normalize_market_position_context`
    (ground truth — this IS what ships, not docs about it).
  - `v2_mint_deploy.py` (this dir) — the proven-live SIWE/RelayerApiKey mint flow,
    reused verbatim here via `_mint_relayer_api_key`.
  - data-api `https://data-api.polymarket.com/positions` — the source of which
    conditions are `redeemable=True` and how much they're worth right now.
  - live `eth_call` against Polygon mainnet (this session, 2026-07-05) — confirmed
    each conditionId's `payoutDenominator`/`payoutNumerators` on the raw CTF
    contract is set (i.e. genuinely resolved on-chain), and confirmed the missing
    ERC-1155 approval as the exact revert cause. Note: `CTF.getPositionId` shows
    the actually-held ERC-1155 token IDs are derived from **USDC.e** collateral
    (`0x2791Bca1…`), not pUSD, even though V2 trading itself settles in pUSD —
    this script still passes `env.collateral_token` (pUSD) to the adapter call
    exactly as the SDK's own `redeem_positions()` does (unchanged from its
    internal code), since the adapter (not raw CTF) is the actual call target and
    is Polymarket's own tested conversion path; the real payout currency is
    confirmed empirically after the tx (pUSD balance check), not assumed here.

Ledger (VINEYARD ADAPTATION — discrepancy D6(d)): a prior reference version of this file appended
results via an external CANONICAL earn-ledger writer script. Vineyard does not vendor that file
(out of scope, spec §8 — `core/ledger.mjs` on the Node side is the sole ledger writer here); this
script still derives + prints the {earn,cost,tx,status} facts per redeemed condition (unchanged), and
`engines/polymarket.mjs`'s `redeem()` wrapper hands each printed line to
`core/ledger.mjs::appendLedger()` instead.

VINEYARD ADAPTATIONS (D6, applied 2026-07-05 — 4 documented edits + 1 additional dependency fix found
while reading this file's actual imports, not in the plan's original D6 text):
  (a) DEPOSIT_WALLET now reads os.environ["POLYMARKET_DEPOSIT_WALLET"] instead of a hardcoded address;
      the AGENT_ENV/LEDGER_RECORD_JS constants (hardcoded external paths) are removed.
  (b) build_client() no longer calls load_dotenv(AGENT_ENV) — the Node wrapper
      (engines/polymarket.mjs) already injects POLYGON_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY into this process's own env.
  (c) _mint_relayer_api_key()'s relayer-key cache path is now
      os.environ.get("POLYMARKET_RELAYER_CACHE", "~/.vineyard/.pm-relayer-apikey") instead of a
      hardcoded external path.
  (d) record_ledger_line() and its call site are removed (see the ledger note above); main()'s
      per-condition result dict carries the raw `line` object instead of a `profitable` bool.
  (e) NOT in the plan's D6 text — found by actually reading this file's real imports: the original
      does `from v2_recipe import pusd_balance`, but v2_recipe.py (a much larger file with unrelated
      cross-chain-relay-funding logic Vineyard doesn't need — Task 8's fund_via_bridge.py already
      covers funding) is not vendored. `pusd_balance()` is inlined below instead of vendoring that
      whole file, using the exact same on-chain read (`ERC20.balanceOf`, 6-dec pUSD) it used.

NO DRY RUN — running `main()` submits real on-chain redeem transactions.

    """R1: submit the redeem tx for one condition and wait for a terminal on-chain
    outcome.

    The SDK's own convenience wrapper `SecureClient.redeem_positions()` has a
    real bug for our exact use case: internally it calls
    `list_markets(condition_ids=[condition_id])` WITHOUT `closed=True`, and the
    Gamma API silently omits closed (resolved) markets unless `closed` is
    explicitly requested (verified live: `curl gamma-api/markets?slug=...`
    returns `[]`, `?slug=...&closed=true` returns the market) — so the wrapper
    always raises `UserInputError("No market found")` for exactly the resolved
    markets redeem() exists to handle.

    This calls the SAME underlying primitives the wrapper would
    (`normalize_market_position_context` + `ctf_redeem_positions_call` +
    `client._dispatch_single_call`, secure.py:2232-2246) but fetches the market
    with `closed=True` first. Dispatch still picks standard vs neg-risk purely
    from the market's own `negRisk` flag (R5) — only the market LOOKUP changed."""
